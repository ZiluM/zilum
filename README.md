# Hi There

Hi, I am Zilu Meng, a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, working under the guidance of Prof. Gregory J. Hakim and Prof. Eric J. Steig.

My research interests include paleoclimate, machine learning, climate dynamics, and data assimilation. 

Currently, I am focusing on paleoclimate data assimilation and exploring climate dynamics during the last millennium. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading, and hiking.
